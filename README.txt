This code implements lighting effect with texturing and allows you to view from 
orthographic view, perspective view, and first person navigation of a 3D scene in OpenGL.

The following are the controls

Iterate through projections - 'p'. When shifting to first person mode, viewing angles get reset
Change angle of view in ortho or perspective modes - Arrow Keys
Move forward in first person mode - 'w'
Move backward in first person mode - 's'
Move left in first person mode - 'a'
Move right in first person mode - 'd'
Move up in first person mode - 'q'
Move down in first person mode 'z'

Adjust angle of view - Click on quadrant of desired camera angle 
(i.e. clicking on the top left corner adjusts your camera angle to look slightly up and to the left)
WARNING: if you walk through/past the models and then try to turn around to see them from behind, this is possible.
It simply takes a ton of mouse clicks. Just be patient. 

Snap view to front of models - '1'
Snap view to back of models - '2'
Snap view to top of models looking down - '3'
Snap view to bottom of models looking up- '4'
Snap view to left of models looking right - '5'
Snap view to right of models looking left - '6'

Turn light on or off - 'l'
Increase light height - '+'
Decrease light height - '-'
Increase and decrease ambient light - '<' and '>'
Toggle modulate and replace - 'm'
Toggle smooth and flat viewing - F1
Toggle local viewing - F2
Toggle light distance - F3
Pause/Play light - F4

Type make and then run by typing ./hw6.exe
Assignment took approximately 10 hours to complete. It took a very long time to find appropriate textures.
